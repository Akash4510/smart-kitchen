#Smart Kitchen
Smart Kitchen device made using NodeMCU, DHT11(Temperature Sensor), MQ2(Gas Sensor), Flame Sensor and IR Sensor.
Work has been done towards finding an integrated solution for the problems (Fire, smoke, hazards, etc.) that are very common now-a- days and these may lead to accidents and even loss of life. Using various sensors and a IoT controller, the system has been designed for giving the control to the userâ€™s mobile so that any kind of accidents can be stopped beforehand. The user will have access to the parameters (Temperature, smoke, sudden movement etc.) in real time. The user will be notified when parameters go out the safe limits. There will also be additions equipment that can be activated remotely in case of an accident to minimize the loss ensuring the safety. The controlling can be transferred based on the requirement and only authorized used it possible. The mobile and IoT connections is possible through Wi-Fi or internet at both ends. The user can control the operations using a app which will establish connection between the mobile and IoT through internet.
